### Game overview
The game is a version of the reversi game, a strategy game for two players played on a 8 X 8 board. Each player has 32 disks, either red or black. The players take turns to place on the board. The player can only place a disk on an empty square that will result on an opponent's piece, or a row of opponent's pieces, to be flanked by the players disks. The surrounded pieces are then swapped for the player's disks. The player that first runs out of disks wins.

### Game Instructions
1. Choose the option you want to play on the starter page. On single player mode the computer will play against you.
