### Game overview
The game is a version of the reversi game, a strategy game for two players played on a 8 X 8 board. Each player has 32 disks, either red or black. The players take turns to place a disk of their color on the board. The player can only place their disk on a empty square so the opponent's piece, or a row of opponent's pieces, is flanked by your pieces. The player that finishes first with all their disks wins.
