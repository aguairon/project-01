### Game overview
The game is a version of the reversi game, a strategy game for two players played on a 8 X 8 board. Each player has 32 disks, either red or black. The players take turns to place on the board. The player can only place a disk on an empty square that will result on an opponent's piece, or a row of opponent's pieces, to be flanked by the players disks. The surrounded pieces are then swapped for the player's disks. The player that first runs out of disks wins.

### Controls
Place a disk by clicking on a square. If it is a valid move it will place the disk of your colour. If not it will show, for a second, a shadow of a disk.
There is also a button to restart the game.

### Game Instructions
1. Choose the option you want to play on the starter page. On single player mode the computer will play against you.

2. Once the option is chosen the 8 X 8 board will appear with 2 disks on each colour on their initial positions. The turns are indicated by an icon next to the two players' name.
